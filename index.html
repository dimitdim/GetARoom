      <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
      <p><u>Team Members:</u> This group has only two team members, Dimitar Dimitrov, and Kyle Flores.  Both members are in the 3:20 to 5:00 section, and will meet during that class period.</p>
      <p><u>Project Summary:</u> We plan to create a sensing network capable of determining whether or not a room is use.  The system should be designed such that new sensing nodes (rooms) can be easily added to the network.  Users should be able to access the system remotely and see if a room is in use, or not in use, saving users the (admittedly short) walk only to find a room occupied.  To preserve the privacy of people using the rooms, only true/false data on room usage should be collected and stored.  Additionally, the software will be presented in a user friendly interface.</p>
      <p><u>Minimum deliverable:</u> Software that informs the user whether a light is on in a remote room.</p>
      <p><u>Extensions:</u>  There are multiple possible extensions for this project that involve improving sensing capabilities or analyzing sensor data.  Additional sensors, such as temperature or sound sensors, can be added to the package.  Temperature readings could detect for example, if a window has been left open in the middle of winter, leaving the room undesirable.  Sound sensors can help differentiate between the presence of humans, and a forgotten light, if the most basic sensor package is assumed to be only light sensitive.  After the software has existed for a long enough period of time, it can be used to predict usage patterns based on known trends.  Finally, sensor data can be mapped to usage patterns to help optimize room characteristics (such as temperature) based on likelihood of use at a given time.  Finally, the software interface can be made remotely accessible and be given a aesthetically pleasing interface</p>
      <p><u>First step:</u> We should start this project by developing a simple sensor package to determine if a room is in use, or not in use.  This will likely involve detecting if the light is on or off (aided by the fact that most rooms at Olin have auto lights off), and if there is a high sound volume.  Other instruments can later be added, but we would probably start with these.</p>
      <p><u>Biggest problem:</u> Hardware sensing and networking.  One option is to use RasPi’s with the onion.io client to aid with networking</p>
      <p><u>GitHub:</u> https://github.com/dimitdim/GetARoom</p>
      
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <u><p>0. Hardware:</p></u><ul>
      <li>We have an ambient light sensor and a temperature sensor attached to an Arduino</li>
      <li>We will have a microphone with an envelope filter attached, time permitting</li>
      <li>We also have a proximity sensor attached, which detects the opening of a door</li>
      <li>We have a status LED attached as well</li>
      <li>We’re using an ENC28J60 card for ethernet</li>
      <li>Time permitting, we may reduce the price per kit by programming ATMega’s instead of Arduino’s and using ENC28J60 chips</li></ul>
      <u><p>1. Arduino Code</p></u><ul>
      <li>The Arduino code uses an ENC28J60 and an Ethercard library to host a website displaying a python dictionary of raw sensor data and hardware uptime</li>
      <li>Data includes readings from the temperature and light sensors.  It will also include ambient sound data.</li>
      <li>Data also includes current status of door and time (in terms of hardware uptime) door last detected to be open</li></ul>
      <u><p>2. Data Collection</p></u><ul>
      <li>Nodes are initialised according to a configuration file; a SQL entry in the Nodes is created if the node is new</li>
      <li>In the future, this file will be updated with a DHCP-assigned IP when a new sensor kit is started</li>
      <li>Every 10 seconds, the current hosted website is downloaded and parsed for data values</li>
      <li>A SQL entry in the Data table is created with the raw data, linking to the Node it originated from</li>
      <li>Nonsensical data is disregarded</li></ul>
      <u><p>3. Data Storage</p></u><ul>
      <li>Data is stored and organized using Flask-SQLAlchemy</li></ul>
      <u><p>4. Data Analysis</p></u><ul>
      <li>A script is running detecting long-term changes in the 'last opened' value for each node</li>
      <li>Every time the door is opened, the status of the room is analysed</li>
      <li>If there is a significant increase and/or a rapid fluctuation of any of the parameters, the status of the room is set to occupied</li>
      <li>If there is a significant decrease in any of the parameters, the status is set to vacant</li>
      <li>If none of the parameters change significantly, the status does not change either</li>
      <li>Statuses only change at open-door times</li>
      <li>Time of change is recorded along with node and status in the Status SQL table</li>
      <li>We will survey use of rooms for a period of time to validate and tune our algorithm</li></ul>
      <u><p>5. Frontend</p></u><ul>
      <li>A website is hosted using the Flask library for Python</li>
      <li>Flask's Login Manager has users login using an OpenID and stores their information in the Users SQL table</li>
      <li>Users can set preffered temperature scale - more custamization will be available in the future</li>
      <li>List of Nodes with data is displayed</li>
      <li>Each node link generates a page displaying the most recent Status database entry, converted for human readibility.  It also diplasys the last time the data was updated</li>
      <li>The page also displays the last 10 statuses, including time, by parsing the Status table</li>
      <li>In the future, we will talk to IT for campus server space (ideally) or figure out a way to integrate using Heroku with the LAN-connected hardware</li></ul>

<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
